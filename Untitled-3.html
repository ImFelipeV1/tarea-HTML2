    <h3>My dog Sasha is my best friend. She likes to chose the football ball when I practice. It is so funny to see her running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth. It just won't </fieldset></text></h3>
    <h3>Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old. I started to go into the street to get a ball that had ralled across the street. Of course I did not think to lok for cars! Sasyha got it in front of me and knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk. I was mad until I saw the car go by where I would have been. Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was</h3>
